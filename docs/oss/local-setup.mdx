### Cloning the docker Repository

To streamline your setup, we recommend using our Docker repository, which comes pre-configured with essential services like Supertokens, Typesense, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
This setup also includes the server and webapp, making it easier to manage everything in one place.

#### Steps:

1. **Install Docker:** Make sure Docker is installed on your workstation, and ensure you're using the latest version of Docker Compose. [See instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Clone the Docker Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/docker.git
cd docker
```

3. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run the start script

```bash
./start.sh
```

Once all docker images are running, your terminal will be like below:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/docker-running.png" />
</Frame>

### Cloning the Tegon Repository

Once Docker is set up, you can proceed with cloning the Tegon repository to start development.

#### Steps:

1. Clone the Tegon Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon.git
cd tegon
```

2. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

4. Start Development Server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Upon successful execution, you should see a screen similar to this:

</Frame>

5. **Access the application:** Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You'll be greeted with a login screen. Enter your email and click `Send Magic Link`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/enter-email.png" />
</Frame>

6. **Retrieve the magic link:** If you haven't provided SMTP credentials in your `.env` file, you won't receive the magic link via email. Instead, find it in the server logs from the previous step.

Copy the URL indicated by the red arrow (press 'c' to copy) and paste it into your browser to bypass local authentication.

7. Provide your details to setup the your account

8. **Create your first issue:** Your workspace should now look like this, type 'C' to create your first issue in your local setup.
